## Didactic Material  

> This material has been developed for the students of the Web Engineering course. 
Since knowledge *should* be considered everyone's heritage, my material is available to anyone who wants
to study the course topics. However, such material *cannot be used, even in part, for other purposes
or in other courses*, without my explicit permission and without citing the source.

> The Web Engineering course is currently given in Italian. The material include an English translation 
of all the slides used during the course lectures. Such a translation is the first result 
of a long and complex adaptation work. Therefore, the slides may still contain some errors, typos 
and poorly readable statements. I'll do my best to refine them, but it takes time. 
Suggestions are always appreciated!
